# THRESHOLDING
## Aim
To segment the image using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and Otsu's thresholding using python and OpenCV.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7
2. OpenCV

### Algorithm
### Step1:
Load the original image using cv2.imread() and convert it from BGR to RGB. Also, load the grayscale version of the image for further processing.

### Step2:
Apply different global thresholding methods like binary, inverse binary, to-zero, to-zero inverse, and truncate using cv2.threshold().

### Step3:
Use Otsu's method to automatically determine the threshold value and segment the grayscale image into foreground and background.

### Step4:
Implement adaptive thresholding (mean and Gaussian) using cv2.adaptiveThreshold() to handle varying lighting conditions in different parts of the image.

### Step5:
Use matplotlib to visualize the original image and the thresholded results side by side in subplots, with appropriate titles for each technique used

# Read the Image and convert to grayscale
image = cv2.imread("goat.jpg")  # Read the image using imread
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)  # Convert the color from BGR to RGB
image_gray = cv2.imread("goat.jpg", 0)  # Grayscale image

# Use Global thresholding to segment the image
ret, thresh_dipt1 = cv2.threshold(image_gray, 86, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Use Otsu's method to segment the image
ret, thresh_dipt6 = cv2.threshold(image_gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
